## Module objectives
- By the end of the module
	- Describe the role of an ethical hacker
	- Describe what you **can** do legally as an ethical hacker
	- Describe what you **cannot** do legally as an ethical hacker
## Introduction to ethical hacking
- **Ethical hackers:** hired contractors
	- penetration test / pentest: attempts to break into a company or adversary's network to find weak links
- **Vulnerability assessments:** testers attempt to enumerate all vulns on an app or system
- **Security test:** tester scans the company SOP
	- Test then reports vulns to boss 
## The role of pentesters
- **Hackers** access computer systems or networks
	- Can be considered breaking the law, can go to prison
- **Crackers** break into systems to steal or destroy data, labelling all illegal access to computers as hacking
- **Ethical hackers** perform most or all of the same activities as a hacker does, with permission from the owner of the network or company
- **Script kiddies / skids** are towards younger, inexperienced people who copy code or use tools created by knowledgeable programmers with understand how they work
- Programs used by experienced pentesters:
	- Used to carry out attacks
	- Python, Ruby, C, Perl, SQL, etc.
	- Scripts
		- Sets of instructions (see BASH language)
		- Runs in sequence to perform tasks
- **Hacktivist** is a person who hacks computer systems for political or social reasons
- **Pentesters** usually have a laptop computer with multiboots/hacking tools
	- Job requirements 
		- Perform vulns, attacks, and pentest reports
		- In internet, intranet, and wireless / IOT
	- Perform port scanning and discovery
	- Apply appropriate exploits to gain access and expand access
	- Participates in activities
		- Application hacking and application source code review
	- Interact with clients as required through contractual engagement
	- Debriefs client
	- Participates in research to improve own skillset and knowledge sharing
	- Demonstrates good understanding of current country, state, and city cyber laws
## Penetration testing methodologies
- **White/clear box model:** the tester is told what network layout and hardware the company is using, alongside with a floorplan of the building's physical layout
	- The tester is permitted to interview IT personnel and company employees
		- Makes the pentester's job easier
-  **Black box model:** staff is not aware of the test, and the tester is not given any information prior about the company technologies being used
	- Burden is on the tester to find details using different techniques
	- Test security personnel's ability to detect an attack
- **Grey-box model:** Hybrid of the white and black box models
	- Company gives the pentester limited or otherwise partial information
		- *Ex: OSs are used, but the test is not given any network diagrams.*
